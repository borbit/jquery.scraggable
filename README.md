#About

**jQuery.scraggable** is a plugin that lets you drag elements by means of scrolling, single and multi dimensional (depends on browser). Implementation of this plugin was inspired by working on [HTML5 puzzle](http://puzzle.borbit.com) game you can [see now](http://puzzle.borbit.com). To see it in action just go to [the link](http://puzzle.borbit.com), wait until a puzzle is loaded (beware! puzzle can be > 3 mb) and try to scroll it (sure if your monitor is not bigger than a puzzle).
